# NRSTED-Pytorch
This is a pytorch implementation of NRSTED

NRSTED is an opinion-unaware and distortion-unaware (OU-DU) no reference (NR) video quality assessment algorithm. This method was proposed in the paper: S. Mitra, R. Soundararajan and S. S. Channappayya, "Predicting Spatio-Temporal Entropic Differences for Robust No Reference Video Quality Assessment," in IEEE Signal Processing Letters, vol. 28, pp. 170-174, 2021, doi: 10.1109/LSP.2021.3049682.
